# HR-Analytics-Dashboard: Employee Attrition Dashboard



###  Short Description
This project involves the creation of a comprehensive HR Analytics Dashboard using Power BI to analyze employee attrition within a company. The dashboard provides a multi-faceted view of attrition, breaking it down by various demographic and professional factors to identify key trends, patterns, and areas of concern. The ultimate goal is to provide actionable insights that can help the HR department formulate strategies to improve employee retention.

### Features and Highlights
*   **High-Level KPI Cards:** At-a-glance metrics for total employees, attrition count, attrition rate (16%), average age, average tenure, and average income.
*   **Interactive Slicers:** The dashboard can be filtered by department (Human Resources, Research & Development, Sales) to provide department-specific insights.
*   **Demographic Analysis:** Detailed breakdowns of attrition by age, gender, and educational background.
*   **Job-Specific Insights:** Analysis of attrition by job role, years at the company, and salary level.

### Key Questions Addressed
The dashboard is designed to answer critical business questions regarding employee turnover:
1.  What is the overall attrition rate and how many employees have left?
2.  Which age group is most likely to leave the company?
3.  Is there a significant difference in attrition between male and female employees?
4.  Which educational backgrounds are most common among employees who leave?
5.  How does salary level correlate with the likelihood of attrition?
6.  At what point in an employee's tenure (in years) is attrition highest?
7.  Which specific job roles have the highest turnover rates?

### Business Impact and Key Insights

This dashboard uncovers several critical insights that can directly inform HR strategy and decision-making:

**1. Attrition is Heavily Concentrated in Low-Salary Brackets.**
*   **Insight:** A staggering **158 out of 229** attritions (nearly 70%) come from employees earning **"Upto 5k"**.
*   **Business Impact:** This strongly suggests that compensation is a primary driver of turnover, especially for entry-level or junior positions. The company is at high risk of losing talent to competitors offering better pay.
*   **Recommendation:** Conduct a market salary review for the lowest-paid roles. Consider salary adjustments or improved benefits packages to remain competitive and retain talent.

**2. Early Tenure is a Critical Period for Retention.**
*   **Insight:** There is a massive spike in attrition among employees who have been with the company for just **one year** (57 attritions).
*   **Business Impact:** This indicates potential issues with the onboarding process, unmet expectations set during hiring, or a lack of initial support and engagement.
*   **Recommendation:** Revamp the new-hire onboarding program. Implement a mentorship system and conduct check-ins at the 3, 6, and 12-month marks to address concerns proactively.

**3. Specific Job Roles are High-Risk.**
*   **Insight:** The top three roles contributing to attrition are **Laboratory Technician (60)**, **Sales Executive (55)**, and **Research Scientist (44)**.
*   **Business Impact:** High turnover in these specific roles can disrupt team productivity, institutional knowledge, and operational stability.
*   **Recommendation:** Conduct targeted exit interviews and focus groups for these roles to understand the specific pain points, which could be related to workload, management, or lack of career growth opportunities.

**4. The 26-35 Age Group is the Most Vulnerable.**
*   **Insight:** Employees aged **26-35** represent the largest group of departing employees (111 attritions).
*   **Business Impact:** This demographic is typically in a phase of rapid career advancement. Losing them means losing a pipeline of future leaders and experienced professionals.
*   **Recommendation:** Develop and clearly communicate career progression paths and professional development opportunities for this age group to show them a long-term future within the company.
